## Ebay Monitor


</div>

### Description

This is something designed for the serious Ebay-er. It lets you watch up to 5 auctions at once and allows you to choose how often to refresh each one. -- Sorry I forgot the 2 OCX files but they are there now
 
### More Info
 
If you have a slow computer (or very little memory) and have multiple auctions open then use 1 minute refresh as the 15 second option could cause your system to lag.
